        "title": "Great fitness tracker watch with many features",
        "text": "I brought this watch a month ago to help me with tracking my indoor cycling and outdoor walking sessions. I do a lot of walks on my work breaks which it also allows to track with GPS so gives an accurate picture of the sessions. I purchased cadence and speed sensors online to attach to my indoor bike which connected to the Garmin Forerunner 55 as it has ANT+ and Bluetooth capability. This gives me an accurate picture of the indoor cycling sessions and actually pushes me to do better than the last time. the battery lasts 7 days during which I do 4 to 5 sessions a week of indoor cycling at 30 minutes a go and similar amount of walking sessions. I also have the heart rate monitor on for 24/7 monitoring. There are many more features and fitness tracking modes like running, HIIT, treadmill, track run, outdoor cycling and more. It also connects to my mobile phone via Bluetooth so I can see messages and emails on the watch and also answer calls but not talk into it as its just a controller for calls on the phone. Overall a solid 9 out of 10 for me as it's exactly what I need. The only thing letting it down is the strap can be a bit fiddly to get on and slightly uncomfortable but you can purchase your own as it's a quick release strap.",

        "text": "Bought the light blue watch to monitor and motivate me with my running (started running on receipt of watch). It really does help keep me focused, as it records my small but incremental improvements, which helps me feel as if I am making progress and motivates me to do better.\n\nI have also been using it to record my cycling to and from work and daily walks and it is good to see how much activity I actually do.\n\nThe watch syncs easily with the dedicated Garmin app and Strava too, so you can share your activities with and receive encouragement from others. You can also add widgets via the app which link to your phone and allow you to receive notifications, weather updates, your emails messages etc. directly to the watch.\n\nThe battery life is good. I am getting around a week before I need to charge it. On average, this equates to about 8-9 hours with GPS on whilst running and cycling (this is what tends to drain the battery), with GPS off for the remaining time and counting my steps.\n\nI am really happy with the watch, with it a good price for a piece of tech that does exactly what I want.

        "title": "Perfect For Beginners",
        "text": "After having a Fitbit Versa 3 break on me, I felt it was time to take the step up to Garmin and I wasn't disappointed. Paid the extra \u00a38 for Grade A over a Grade B and it came in perfect condition; I even had the satisfaction of peeling off the screen peel. I purchased a fabric strap on Amazon for around \u00a37 which is more comfortable than the silicone one that comes with the watch, but that's provided anyway if you're fine with that!\n\nThe Forerunner 55 is not touchscreen, so going from a touchscreen watch to buttons was a bit of a change, but one I'm actually so pleased I made too. You spend less time as a robot with your eyes locked into the watchface, and the battery is perfect too. I get at least 5+ days including logging my 2.5k runs, 5k runs, and workouts midweek.\n\nAccuracy has been spot on with turning corners, connects to GPS in no time at all before a run, and logs to Garmin Connect within seconds, which then moves over to your Strava account once you have those all connected up.\n\nI genuinely can't fault it and won't be returning to Fitbit again. Garmin has won me over. If this is the 'budget version' of their products, I can only imagine how good their higher end products are as this does more than enough for a beginner/intermediate runner like myself.\n\nSomething that also made this watch worth it is with Fitbit, I was paying for Premium each month for \u00a37.99 for most of the features you get on this for free, it's a no brainer. After a month or so with this, it's paid for the extra amount I would have spent on Premium going forward.\n\nTL:DR... 100% worth paying that tiny bit extra over a Versa/Fitbit watch and going for that Grade A through CeX, no issues whatsoever.",

Don't follow so much their metrics. Good to see pacing, heart rate, distance, and speed. I LOVE their daily suggested workout. Use it for 1.5 months so far and my pacing is becoming faster.",

GPS is great, training plans are pretty comprehensive, data is near accurate, and overall the device has all the tools a casual runner needs.\n\nThe only downsides:\n- No touch screen\n- Sleep Tracker has no score and you manually have to change your normal sleep and wake time if you\u2019re sleeping on a different schedule. It doesn\u2019t detect whenever you go to sleep\n- Music controls are buggy and a bit of a chore to operate while running",

You still have body battery with the 55. For performance stats, HRV is not available on the 55, so you don't get training status stats, like chronic/acute load. I don't find my 265 big (I don't have the small version) and I do find the screen is easier to read because it is a bit bigger than my 55 and it's LED, not MIP. The FR55 has a 20 hour battery on GPS mode and 13 days for normal day to day use which is the same as the 265. It really depends what features you want.",

No need to let FOMO force you to get a more expensive watch as watches get outdated very quickly. If you persevere and need a better watch in future, you can always upgrade later and then get the latest stats on a new watch.",

I use navigation regularly when running long distances. Strava live segments - very underrated feature! Very handy way to motivate and push yourself! For those who don't know, this allows racing Strava segments with real time feedback of how much you are ahead of behind. Much better GPS accuracy with a more modern GPS chipset and dual-frequency L1/L5 GPS. This is important when running in cities with tall buildings, in a dense forest, in mountains, canyons, etc. Yes, I do all of that. Also, this produces better pace and distance accuracy. Battery life to survive 100 mile ultras. I do that as well. Advanced recovery features, Endurance score, and Hill score.",

After about 12 hours I loved the screen, saves battery and can be read just as well as an analogue watch. Hobby runner, hiker and like to be out and about. Downside: the map is just a line instead of a full on map. It's still useful for getting your bearings on bigger runs/ getting back to the car in a new city. Upside: everything else!",
