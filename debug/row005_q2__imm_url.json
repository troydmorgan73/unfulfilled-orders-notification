        "title": "Best Edge Screen Ever!",
        "text": "With me getting older, having a big, bright screen was a major requirement and the Edge 1050 delivers on that and more! I upgraded from a 1030 and the difference is night and day. The 1050 is not only brighter, but the responsiveness is like using a mobile phone. Some other likes and dislikes:\n\n- The bell is nice but I can\u2019t access easily with my older DI2 setup.\n\n- The community hazards is a good idea but needs more adoption in my area to be useful. I haven\u2019t had a hazard warn me of something I wouldn\u2019t have caught myself.\n\n- I like the new Real Time Stamina. Seems to accurately reflect my potential at any point of a ride.\n\n- Swiping up to get the widget glances is a nice touch.\n\n- Identifying high use streets and paths in the map is annoying. There needs to be a heat map like coloring to distinguish the roads most taken when just riding in an area you don\u2019t know.\n\n- Climbpro has rarely shown my accurate location on the hill. It seems to represent me being about 5-10% further along than I actually am (even with the highest location accuracy setting).\n\n- Battery life has been fine. Recent 40 mile ride used up about 20% of battery from full.\n\n- Setup was a nightmare. I still have so many problems loading ConnectIQ fields.\n\n4 stars overall, but can anticipate a 5 star device with upgrades to ConnectIQ usage, and some mapping / routing improvements.",

        "text": "The Edge 1050 is a peculiar product. The fundamentals of the screen and battery life are great. That said, here are the issues:\n\nRoad hazard warning - This new Waze-like feature seems silly for bike riding. It busily dinged away announcing potholes galore, which was no help at all as I had no idea whether the reported pothole was a routine bump or a wheel eating ditch. The animal alert was even more confusing as I it might be telling me about a vicious dog who resides in the neighborhood or a perhaps alerting me that a squirrel had crossed the road three days ago. No idea which as I saw neither dogs nor squirrels.\n\nRadar defaults - I connected it to my Garmin Varia radar and the default audio alert clangs like crazy when a vehicle is about to pass. Moreover, it put the detected vehicles on the right side of the display, which makes sense for the UK, Australia, and Japan but is counter intuitive for the US and Europe. With all the clanging and dinging for potholes and radar alerts, my riding buddy said that I sounded like a pachinko parlor.\n\nWhen I got home from my first ride I spent an hour changing various defaults - radar alerts, disable road hazard warnings, disable auto-rerouting, disable sharp bend warnings, disable nutrition tracking, etc. What kind of product requires you to watch YouTube videos to verify your sanity in wanting to disable large parts of the product, including touted new features. Don\u2019t they know that the majority of users do not change defaults.\n\nMeanwhile, you are still required to use the touch swipe gesture to change pages, which is an essential activity. For me this was not reliable, even with bare fingers in dry conditions, and often required a second or sometimes a third attempt. I wonder how well it works with gloves or when wet from rain or sweat. Unfortunately, one of the few items that you apparently can not customize are the hardware buttons, as one of them (lap button) would be ideal to use as a next page button.\n\nOverall, a mixed product. I will probably keep it, especially as I have already invested time in customization, but it's no wonder that competitors like Wahoo and Hammerhead are trying to produce devices that are simpler to use.",

Pinpoint GPS accuracy from Garmin Maps, uses the same Garmin Connect app as other models to download GPX files, with the added advantage of the upgraded software that warns of road features (sharp bends, junctions, pot holes). The information when going up steep hills is also very useful for timing gear changes\n\nI have paired this with the new Garmin radar and the two work extremely well together, it\u2019s great to get advance notice of vehicles approaching from behind, I find this especially useful on the single track roads I use.\n\nThe outfront holder sits rock solid on my handlebars and positions the unit perfectly to keep an eye on all data without taking your eyes off the road, the screen is visible in all conditions from bright sunlight to more shaded routes\n\nI am really pleased I waited for this unit to become available and paid the extra money for it, as well as pairing it with the radar",
