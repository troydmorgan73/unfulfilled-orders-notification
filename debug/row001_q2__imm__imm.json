As a result, it often slips off the axle together with the cassette when the wheel is removed. As the pawls are also not attached in any way, they usually end up on the ground as well. Extremely annoying at home, a potential worst-case scenario on the road - if one of the pawls gets lost, that's it. Inserting the pawls and the freehub body is also extremely fiddly. An absolute engineering fail, hence only 2 stars.",

The wheel does not catch the wind anywhere near as much as my previous wheel. The only slight improvement would be to provide a flat seating area for the tubeless valve clamp nut to seat and seal against. With the existing design it is possible to over tighten when trying to get the valve to seal creating high stress leading to cracks being created. I have read reviews where people have had issues with cracks starting in this area. So be careful not to overtighten the valve.",

The Zipp 303s are my first set of carbon wheels and I couldn\u2019t be happier with them! They\u2019re not the lightest around but they feel solid and are a massive improvement. The reduction in weight saw an immediate improvement on my Strava efforts. About 2 weeks after fitting these I did start to see some bad reviews on this wheel set which did concern me initially, however having done a 115km gravel epic on some very challenging terrain on the North Yorkshire moors any doubt was quickly removed! The bad reviews mainly mention the hub bearings however I think these are from previous versions (time will tell). They are very easy to set up tubeless and are fast rolling. They feel well built and handle corners well. They also look great and will not break the bank either. For a sub \u00a31000 wheel set they are a no brainier in my opinion.",

A bit of grease in there could make them almost silent if that's your preference. The inner rim width is perfect for high volume tyres, which went on the rims easy with no levers. Tubeless set up was easy. Great looking and performing wheels. Very happy. Only negative would be that the engagement isn't instant and can be feel a little sloppy compared the the 54t Ratchet on my dtswiss hubs, but it's not really a massive issue for me.",
