So it is not due to the wheels.\n\nI have of course sent both tires back.\n\nIn addition, Continental strangely does not print the tire data with the max. air pressure on the sidewall as usual, but in the tread, so that the tread is only half present on more than 50 cm ... but somehow fits the out-of-round tire.\n\nAnyway, that was my first and last tire from Continental.",
