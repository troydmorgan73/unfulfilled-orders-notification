      "description": "Sticks and stones and other sharp, pointy objects won't stop Continental's Touring Plus tire. It's armed with Continental's stalwart Plus flat protection system, a tough sub-tread that prevents punctures. This layer is highly elastic as well, so that the ride remains light and lively. And, nighttime rides just got safer, with Continental's Reflex sidewall striping for high visibility when the sun goes down.",

Most of my riding is commuting, and I put these on just after the snowmelt, just in time for Edmonton's roads to turn into a mess of potholes, sand, kitty litter, winter detritus and more snow.\n\nThey do make my bicycle feel a little slower and heavier. I'm not hitting top gear as easily as I used to. But, given that I'm not racing, it's not so big a deal. This is more than offset by how sure-footed these tires feel, which is a real boon to me given how irregular Edmonton's roads and trails can be. Not only are they grippy, but they really reduce the horrific pounding that one can get riding over cracks and potholes and the like, so I find I have to slow down less to negotiate potentially treacherous situations. I also find that they don't spray anywhere near as much when riding on wet surfaces as many tires that I've ridden with.\n\nPros:\n\n* good value for price\n\n* a good compromise between traction and rolling resistance\n\n* rugged\n\n* good wet weather performance\n\nCons:\n\n* a bit on the heavy/slow side\n\nVerdict: ideal for riding conditions which are less than kind to road bikes.",

Also I over inflate the tire by 10-15 psi to reduce rolling resistance, again no problems, but do not go over rim recommended inflation limits.\nDependable grip and cornering. very puncture resistant.
